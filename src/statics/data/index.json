  "introduction": "I am a software developer based in Manila, Philippines. I have an appetite for learning and a passion for creating software applications that do stuff. When 'm not in front of a computer you'll find me tinkering with hobby electronics or just chillin' beside a cat.",
  "manifesto": "IMHO, computer programming is a discipline of both Science and Art mungled together in perfect harmony. Creating a good software application is more than that though, It's a mixture of technical excellence, domain knowledge, complementary UI/UX and two-way communication between the client and developer - I always strive to deliver all.",

        "Two months after earning my BS in Computer Engineering from Technological Institue of the Philippines, I started working at Nokia as an R&D Engineer I.",
        "I was part of a team responsible for developing and maintaining features of a monolithic user-interface software for base transceiver stations using Java technologies. This is where I started to really have that initial foundation for Software Development. Thanks to my highly competent colleagues and seniors at that time, I learned the ropes - bridged the gap between school and actual industry experience. Discovered agile, clean code, the benefits of Test-Driven development, best practices and many more. I'm very fortunate to have worked here for my 1st Job."

        "Technically my second job, but still with the folks at Nokia working as a Software Specialist that develops and maintains tools and softwares that support the Architecture and Technology Preventive Platforms.",
        "I was a key person responsible for the system architecture design and implementation of various software systems. I had spent enormous amount of time prototyping designing architectures that would fit the requirements. I had tons of fun learning and really immersed myself in the world of good design, refactoring disciplines, SOLID principles and design patterns.",
        "Aside from developing software, I also participated on tons of internal hackathons such as: StraTWOs, VR and IoT. Joined university CodeRetreats as a Facilitator where we visit various universities to provide real-word insights and hopefully imparted inspiration to students that will soon enter the Software industry."
