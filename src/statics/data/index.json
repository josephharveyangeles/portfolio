    "I'm a <strong>Full-Stack Software Engineer</strong> based in Manila, Philippines. I'm very passionate about learning, teaching and just building things in general. And cats, I like cats very much. And also memes. <i>Elon memes, so hot right now.</i>",
    "I used to work as a technical lead at a corporate company but decided to go freelance in the middle of 2018 due to various reasons. I just really feel like this is where I could provide more value for my work; working close and direct with clients. Guiding and providing insights on how to go about developing a software product.",
    "When I'm not working on a client project, I'm developing side projects or fiddling with hobby electronics. I haven't written much these days, but it's also something that I've been planning to work on for years â€” creating regular content to my blog and possibly a youtube channel."
