OLMHRP — Our Lady of the Most Holy Rosary Parish is a church near the hometown when I grew up in. I wrote OSyshub as a solution to help digitized and automate most of the parish-related processes.

OSysHub is purely written in Java and Java Swing to build the UI. OSysHub is just fancy way of saying, System Hub. The idea is to create a unified application that will handle all church related-processes. I designed it with a plugin architecture so I could build every system independently and iteratively on-demand.

Currently, OSysHub contains a Columbary Management System and a Voucher/Cheque Printing feature complete with tests.

I've extracted an API — [Bethelscribe](https://github.com/vycoder/bethelscribe) out of OSysHub and made it public on github.
