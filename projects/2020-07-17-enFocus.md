**The Pomodoro Technique¬Æ** is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirilo in the late 1980's. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks of 5 minutes, and a 15-minute long break after 4 successive sprints. This philosophy aims to provide the user with the maximum focus and creative freshness, thereby allowing them to complete projects faster with less mental fatigue.

**The Eisenhower Method** complements the Pomodoro Technique really well. This method stems from a quote attributed to Dwight D. Eisenhower: *"I have two kinds of problems, the urgent and the important. The urgent are not important, and the important are never urgent."*

The Eisenhower Method is a simple tool for considering the long-term outcomes of your daily tasks and focusing on what will make you most efficient, not just most productive. Visualize all your tasks in a matrix of urgent/important. All of your daily tasks and projects should fall into one of these four quadrants:

- Urgent & Important tasks are to be done immediately
- Not Urgent & Important tasks are to be scheduled or considered in other quadrants
- Urgent & Unimportant tasks are to be delegated to someone else
- Not Urgent & Unimportant tasks are to be deleted
